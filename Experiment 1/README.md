# Experiment 1 

This is my first experiment where I developed a functional program using C!

## Background 

I just finished installing and setting up the software and tools I needed to develop C programs on my device, and I need to know whether my 
device is able to compile and run C programs. 


## About this Experiment 

This experiment will have a C program successfully display a simple message on the Terminal to successfully prove that my device has the 
tools and software needed to fully compile and run C programs!
